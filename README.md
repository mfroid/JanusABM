This ABM is written in Java so requires a recent version of the JDK which can be freely downloaded from here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

We built our Agent-Based Model using the Hybrid Automata Layer, a library that facilitates the development of computationally efficient models. The library was developed by our colleagues at the Moffitt Cancer Center and can be downloaded from here: https://halloworld.org/start_here.html

HAL has extensive documentation and the approach was previously published here: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007635

More about HAL and how to download the latest version can be found here : https://halloworld.org/

For convenience we recommend to use the IntelliJ development environment and to follow the instructions in HAL to integrate the library with it.
